# RichEdit for ASP.NET Core - How to integrate the control into a Blazor server application

## Requirements
- To use the RichEdit control in a Blazor application, you need to have a [Universal, DXperience, or ASP.NET subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
- Versions of devexpress npm packages should be identical (their major and minor versions should be the same).
 
This example illustrates a possible way to integrate the client part of ASP.NET Core RichEdit into a Blazor server application using steps from the following help topic: [Rich Text Editor > Get Started > Blazor Server Application](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401871/rich-edit/get-started/blazor-server-application).
